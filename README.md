# Commonplace-Book
A central resource or depository for ideas, quotes, anecdotes, observations and information I have come across.


>Commonplace books (or commonplaces) are a way to compile knowledge, usually by writing information into books. They have been kept from antiquity, and were kept particularly during the Renaissance and in the nineteenth century. Such books are essentially scrapbooks filled with items of every kind: recipes, quotes, letters, poems, tables of weights and measures, proverbs, prayers, legal formulas. Commonplaces are used by readers, writers, students, and scholars as an aid for remembering useful concepts or facts. Each one is unique to its creator's particular interests but they almost always include passages found in other texts, sometimes accompanied by the compiler's responses.

<a name="albert-camus-fall"></a>*The Fall* - (Albert Camus, 1957)
> Set in Amsterdam, The Fall consists of a series of dramatic monologues by the self-proclaimed "judge-penitent" Jean-Baptiste Clamence, as he reflects upon his life to a stranger. In what amounts to a confession, Clamence tells of his success as a wealthy Parisian defense lawyer who was highly respected by his colleagues. His crisis, and his ultimate "fall" from grace, was meant to invoke, in secular terms, the fall of man from the Garden of Eden. The Fall explores themes of innocence, imprisonment, non-existence, and truth.

Read this book during the summer of 2019.  It is a short and easy read, only took about two days of light reading to finish.
I give it a personal rating of 4/10, not the most compelling story and chock-full of monologues.  Original title of this book is *La Chute*.

Have yet to finish this book.  Not a big fan of the narrative style.

Only two chapters in to this book.  Great book but very dense.
